# PaperTime
catch up on your reading by opening a paper at random at a prescheduled time each day! built in timer defaults to a pomodoro-length reading period (25 min), after which user is asked if they like to keep reading. if you keep reading, the timer resets to another 25 min; if you move on, you can either keep the paper and make a note of its significance, or you can delete it.
